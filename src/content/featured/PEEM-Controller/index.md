Four Micro-Manager 2.0 plugins to control and monitor a Photo Emission Electron Microscope ([PEEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoemission_electron_microscopy)) in conjunction with an image acquisition system and an interferometric delay stage. Not as sexy as nowadays fancy web UIs but it does it job incredibly well and is to this day heavily in use.
