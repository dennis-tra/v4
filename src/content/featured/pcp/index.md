Peer Copy is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file transfer tool based on libp2p. It allows any two parties that are either both on the same network or connected via the internet to transfer the contents of a file based on a particular sequence of words. I published a paper about it at [IFIP '21](https://networking.ifip.org/2021/).
