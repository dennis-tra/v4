As part of my work at [freiheit.com](https://freiheit.com/en/) I built the backend part of the real time event supply for the [Mercedes Benz Mobile SDK](https://developer.mercedes-benz.com/sdks). A status update of a vehicle (like opening a door) or sending a command to the vehicle goes through my code.
