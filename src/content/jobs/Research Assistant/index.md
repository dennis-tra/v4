- Performed frequency analyses of large image sets from a photoemission electron microscope in Python using packages like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Pandas.

- Developed an [automation programme](https://github.com/dennis-tra/peem-controller) which controlled the said microscope and its peripherals in Java.

- This programme utilised a RS232 serial interface of the microscope and a plugin interface of a [camera controlling programme](https://www.micro-manager.org/).

- The tool is still heavily in use and helps accellerating scientific discoveries of the current researchers
